# Homework 5

## Directories
### Make
* Final version of the Makefile made in the Make Exercise

### Installing the Kernel Source
* Kernel version on BBB before install: uname_r=4.4.19-ti-r41
* Kernel version on BBB after install: uname_r=4.4.25-bone14

### Cross-Compiling
* programOutput.txt contains the output from both the host machine as well as the BBB
* a_host.out is the file compiled natively on the host
* a_BBB.out is the file cross-compiled for the BBB

### Pushing to the Cloud
* tmp101.js is a script to read the temperatures from the three temp sensors and then report them to phant
* plotTMP101.html contains the code to plot the data recorded
* keys_tmp101.json contains the key data for the stream

* *Temperature difference between Sensor 2 and the others is most likely because it is located closest to the heat exhaust from my laptop.*
